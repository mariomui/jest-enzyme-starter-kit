The previous problems in v2.3 have mainly been solved.

The purpose of this repo is to prune all the things necessary for this repo to run.

Outline:
1. delete all modules.
2. copy package.json
3. slowly introduce each module back, while testing what is exactly needed for webdevserver, jest and enzyme to run.
